# [PROGRAM NAME] 
Finding Dallin
Dallin is gone! Again...  

Where did he go?  

The last time we saw him was by that stereotypically creepy cave entrance.  

We best go find him. 

And so it begins. 

Structure: 

4 levels to map â€“ one boss and three stages (increasing in difficulty?) 

Beating enemies or moving up a level involves solving a puzzle, beating a rhythm challenge, or something of our discretion 

Set up puzzles/traps/rhythm-games 

Start with puzzles. Add rhythm games after. (mini-game?) 

Heart system (Legend of Zelda) 

How to win/lose: 

Win: Save Dallin 

Lose: Fail to save Dallin by losing too many hearts via incorrect puzzles or <80% accuracy in rhythm.
